keep it social at a distance

### Inspiration

Are you:
- Travelling alone?
- Self-quarantining alone in your room?
- Want to start a conversation with other travellers/stayers around you but everyone must keep a social distance?

Boi do we have something for you

### What it does

- Messaging: talk to other folks in a chat room, or be assigned to a random 1-1 conversation
- Collaborative games: cooperate to solve puzzles
- Movie streaming: I mean Shrek marathon
- Art gallery: where people can showcase anything that they're proud of
- Customer service support & Emergency contact

### How we built it

Backend is express.js. Frontend is built with React and some other open-source libraries for convenience when building frontend components.

### Challenges we ran into

We had to come up with features that are relevant and could appeal to potential users.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of

We made a website! And it be running!!

### What we learned

Some Javascript. Some application of graph algorithms we saw in class. Some frustration when using JS.
